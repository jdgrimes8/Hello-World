Hello-World
===========

Hellow fellow GitHub users!

My name is Jesse Grimes and I am studying to be a Data Analyst. I will be documenting all of my work from the ground up as I learn, and will eventually have everything on this profile be a part of my proffessional portfolio. I look forward to the challenges ahead, and to my future success in the field.
